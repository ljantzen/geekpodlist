#The ultimate Geek Podcast List
===========

As a geek, I enjoy listening to podcasts, not only on technical topics.  This repository contains descriptions of the podcasts I find are of high quality and relevance to geeks.  Most are english-language, some are in other languages.  

I hope you find something of interest here, and welcome pull requests.  Feel free to use my [OPML file](https://github.com/ljantzen/geekpodlist/blob/master/geekpodroll.opml)

### The Java Posse

The Java Posse is probably the first podcast I started listening to.  It is mainly listed here for sentimental reasons.  
The show has been lacking in content quality for some time now. The attempt to produce content at the JavaPosse Roundup 
doesn't work for me, mainly due to sound quality issues.
